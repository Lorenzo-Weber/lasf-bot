# Get iproxy scraping working
# Figure out how to stay loged in
# Get all elements
# Filter by class AND use a ReGex in order to filter IPs
# If a online proxy finds itself on a failed list, remove it from the failed list
# Get its ip, if the filter fails, that specifc proxy is saved as failed
# If the failed proxy is in the failed list, ignores
# Else stores it on the senders list
# Goes one by one on the senders list
# Get its name (It will determinate the group and the proxy itself) 
# Send a message like "Proxy sma 01 est√° offline"
# Resets the proxies list (keeps stored the failed list)
# Resets the senders list
# Waits 5 minutes
